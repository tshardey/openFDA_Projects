# OpenFDA

The FDA publishes a large amount of there public databases to openfda.gov.   The openFDA API allows for sending JSON requests based on a variety of searchable paramaters.  There are a number of endpoints available on the site, but of particular interest to me was the medical device endpoints.  There is a wealth of data on each medical device registered with the FDA, which can be broken down into about four groups:

1. Registrations
2. Recalls
3. Adverse Events
4. Labeling
