    "The purpose of this project is to dive into the Federal Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Medical Device Adverse Event Database (MAUDE).  Medical devices range from band-aids to artificial hearts and x-ray imagers, and are regulated using a risk based approach.  An adverse event is any untoward medical condition that is associated with the medical device, or may be associated with the medical device. \n",
    "\n",
    "Manufacturer's a required to maintain and evaluated complaint, including potential adverse events, for their devices. In addition, MAUDE was developed by the FDA as an additional platform for reporting adverse events.  There is a limited amount of control in how thoroughly the adverse event is reported.  For that reason, there is a lot of missing data in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial json request sent, for all medical device advese events between January 1, 2017 - December 31, 2017 returned a total count of 935708 adverse events.  For this reason, a subset of the data will be used for the initial analysis.  "
